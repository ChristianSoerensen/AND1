My First Android App
A small guide: The code for the layout itself has to be written in the activity_main.xml file, which can be found in app->src->main->res->layout

Any picture that has to be added is placed in the drawable folder.

To center a textView element, android:gravity="center" has to be used
To center a button element, android:layout_gravity="center" has to be used


To use a vertical layout/orientation, in the LinearLayout page, the android:orientation="vertical" has to be used
